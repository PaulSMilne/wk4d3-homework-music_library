# Music Library Lab - Sinatra App


Last week we created a Music app with albums and artists. Create a RESTFul Sinatra app on top of the existing code we created. There should be:

Create routes for albums and artists:

- Index
- New
- Create
- Show

## Extensions

These are extension revision topics and do not need to be completed:

- Create Update and Delete pages for albums / artists
- Add images for albums
- Add some CSS
- Create 'library' route to show all artists and albums!
